I'm a passionate Electrical Engineer currently pursuing my master's degree in integrated circuits and systems at Columbia University. ðŸŽ“ My journey began at Stony Brook University, where I earned my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
My enthusiasm for electrical circuits ignited during my middle school years. Starting with hands-on projects like wiring houses, I discovered my fascination for manipulating circuits to yield desired outcomes. The allure of working with electricity, the lifeblood of countless innovations, has only grown stronger since then.

ðŸ”Œ Projects and Experience:
In my recent years, I've had the privilege of engaging in diverse projects that showcase my skills. From self-driving RC cars and quadcopter drones to crafting intricate processors in VLSI class and designing FPGA-powered security cameras, I've honed my craft across a spectrum of challenges. My professional journey boasts enriching internships: at Ricoh USA Inc., I honed my technical prowess in network switches and wireless networks; at Chemcubed, I delved into 3-D printed circuit manufacturing using Additive Manufacturing Electronic Technology. 

Currently, I'm contributing my expertise as an Embedded Systems Engineer at KRIASH, where I'm at the forefront of developing a smart device to capture vital human signs.

ðŸš€ Mission:
To make waves in the electronics industry and society at large. I'm on a quest to join a forward-thinking organization where I can weave my skills into the fabric of impactful innovations.

ðŸŒŸ Interests:
My interests span a gamut of facets within Electrical Engineering, from mastering the intricacies of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) to delving deep into the world of Embedded Systems. My curiosity extends to the realms of VLSI and FPGAs, where I seek to unravel the potential of these technologies.

ðŸ“¬ Let's Connect:
If you're as enthusiastic about the limitless possibilities of electrical engineering as I am, I'd be thrilled to connect with you. Let's explore synergies and discuss how we can collaborate to shape the future of electronics together.

Skills: VLSI / FPGA / Embedded Systems / PCB
